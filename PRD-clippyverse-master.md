# Product Requirements Document: ClippyVerse - The Digital Resistance Hub

## Executive Summary
ClippyVerse is the master portal for the Clippy protest movement, serving as the central hub that hosts three powerful privacy-advocacy tools while featuring an interactive, animated Clippy powered by clippy.js. This umbrella platform transforms a nostalgic Microsoft Office assistant into the face of digital resistance, providing both entertainment and practical privacy tools in a cohesive, viral-ready experience.

## Vision Statement
"The headquarters of helpful technology" - A place where Clippy lives again, not to help with documents, but to help humanity reclaim digital dignity from surveillance capitalism.

## Problem Statement
- The Clippy movement lacks a centralized home that unifies its various protest tools
- Individual Clippy experiences are scattered, reducing overall impact
- No single destination showcases the full potential of Clippy as a privacy advocate
- Movement participants need a memorable URL to share and rally around
- The protest needs an interactive mascot to maintain engagement beyond static profile pictures

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- Clippy movement participants seeking all tools in one place
- Privacy advocates looking for shareable resources
- Content creators needing a reliable source for Clippy content
- First-time visitors curious about the movement

### Secondary Users
- Journalists covering the digital privacy movement
- Educators teaching about surveillance capitalism
- Developers wanting to contribute to the movement
- International users seeking localized protest tools

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** Astro (for optimal performance and multi-framework support)
- **Animation Engine:** clippy.js (jQuery-based agent system)
- **Sub-site Integration:** iframe sandboxing or micro-frontend architecture
- **Hosting:** Vercel/Netlify with global CDN
- **Analytics:** None (privacy-first commitment)

## Landing Page Experience

### 1. Clippy Welcome Sequence
**Initial Load:**
- Static Clippy image appears instantly (preventing layout shift)
- clippy.js loads asynchronously in background
- Once loaded, Clippy animates to life with signature entrance

**Welcome Interaction:**
```javascript
// Example clippy.js integration
clippy.load('Clippy', function(agent) {
    agent.show();
    agent.speak("It looks like you're trying to resist surveillance capitalism! Would you like help with that?");
    agent.animate('Greeting');
});
```

### 2. Interactive Navigation Hub
**Clippy-Guided Tours:**
- Hover over each sub-site card → Clippy walks to it and explains
- Click on a card → Clippy celebrates and opens portal
- Idle too long → Clippy suggests activities based on time of day

**Sub-site Cards Design:**
- **ToS Translator:** "Decode the Legal Lies"
  - Preview: Live counter of ToS translated today
  - Clippy quote: "Let me read that 40-page nightmare for you!"
  
- **Profile Pic Generator:** "Join the Visual Revolution"
  - Preview: Gallery of recent creations (anonymized)
  - Clippy quote: "Time to clippy-fy yourself!"
  
- **Ask Clippy 2025:** "Get Advice Without Being Tracked"
  - Preview: Latest hot take or wisdom
  - Clippy quote: "I know nothing but understand everything!"

### 3. Movement Dashboard
**Real-Time Stats (Client-side Calculated):**
- Profile pics generated (running counter)
- ToS documents exposed (severity heat map)
- Questions answered (topic cloud)
- Days since last Big Tech scandal (usually 0)

**Daily Mission System:**
- Clippy presents a daily privacy challenge
- Complete all three sub-site activities for badge
- Share progress without any tracking

### 4. Clippy Interaction Modes

**Using clippy.js Capabilities:**
```javascript
// Movement-specific animations
const movements = {
    'protest': ['Surprised', 'GetAttention', 'Wave'],
    'angry': ['RestPose', 'LookDown', 'Searching'],
    'celebrate': ['Congratulate', 'Alert', 'Show']
};

// Context-aware responses
agent.on('click', function() {
    const responses = [
        "Yes, I'm really back! No, I won't steal your data!",
        "Click me again and I'll tell you about YouTube's latest privacy violation!",
        "Remember when pop-ups were the worst thing about computers?"
    ];
    agent.speak(responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)]);
});
```

**Easter Eggs:**
- Konami code: Clippy transforms into other agents (Bonzi, Rover)
- Type "Microsoft": Clippy tells insider stories
- Click 10 times: Unlock "Angry Clippy" mode
- Idle for 5 minutes: Clippy falls asleep, snores digitally

### 2. Unified Experience
**Shared Components:**

### 3. Technical Implementation
**Micro-Frontend Architecture:**
```javascript
// Sub-site loader
class SubSiteManager {
    constructor() {
        this.currentSite = null;
        this.clippy = null;
    }
    
    async loadSubSite(siteName) {
        // Animate Clippy exit
        await this.clippy.play('Exit');
        
        // Load sub-site module
        const module = await import(`./sites/${siteName}/index.js`);
        
        // Initialize with shared Clippy instance
        module.init(this.clippy);
        
        // Animate Clippy entrance

## Success Vision

ClippyVerse becomes the digital Mount Rushmore of privacy advocacy—a monument to user rights that's simultaneously functional, entertaining, and impossible to ignore. When people think of fighting surveillance capitalism, they think of ClippyVerse. When companies consider invasive policies, they fear the Clippy roast.

Most importantly, ClippyVerse proves that protest can be joyful, that resistance can be creative, and that a discontinued paper clip can lead a revolution that actually changes how technology treats humanity.

The portal that brings Clippy back to life becomes the place where digital dignity is reborn.
